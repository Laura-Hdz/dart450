Exercise 02 (Jan 16)
Laura Hernandez

Second exercise: Use jQuery's events (like 'click' and 'mouseover' and 'dblclick') and relevant functions (like animate(), css(), toggle(), and so on). Try to discover at least one jQuery function we didn't talk about in class!

  <h1>Why this book?</h1>
  <p>As an avid gamer, esports has become as important to me as what traditional sports teams are to avid sports fans. It has beome my motivation and goal to use my graphic design skills to help this industry grow and change the often-times narrow-minded view society has towards it.</p>

  <p>As such, books that provide insight into the competition are always interesting to me, and I think are important eye-openers for people who may not understand what competitive gaming entails.</p>
